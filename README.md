# Quick Post For Reddit

Quick Post for Reddit is an Android app designed to simplify the process of submitting pictures to Reddit.
The app allows you to select a picture, title, and subreddit and automatically posts the picture to Imgur, 
then Reddit, all at the press of a button.

The app is still a work in progress.  It currently posts the images to Imgur. The next step is get users'
Reddit credientials view Reddit's oAuth process, along with submitting the post on behalf of the user.
The user interface will also need to be improved.
