# Quick Post For Reddit

Quick Post for Reddit is an Android app designed to simplify the process of submitting pictures to Reddit.
The app allows you to select a picture, title, and subreddit and automatically posts the picture to Imgur, 
then Reddit, all at the press of a button.

The app is still a work in progress.

###To Do

<ul>
<li> Make a progress icon for when the image is being uploaded to Imgur and posted to Reddit </li>
<li> Make the user's default Reddit browser automatically launch once the image is posted. </li>
<li> Develop a better user interface </li>
</ul>
